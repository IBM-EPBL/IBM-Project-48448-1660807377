            Yaayy!! Your pepper plant is healthy. But, take the necessary precautions like, putting the plant where it gets at least 10 hours of direct sunlight. Keep soil evenly moist for good growth. Peppers need well draining soil that is rich and loamy, but avoid too much nitrogen in the soil. Too much nitrogen can cause plenty of leaves and little to no peppers. Your soil should have a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.
